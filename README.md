# Crowd-density-detector
There are a number of CCTV cameras installed at various places on our campus to record the environment. Most of the video surveillance tasks rely on supervisors to monitor the environment. However, there are limitations in the human capability to monitor simultaneous events. It is not feasible for the supervisor to sit all the time, especially at nighttime, in front of the CCTV and monitor the environment. So we need an automated system for security purpose. Automation will help to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Moreover, it will free security guards from routine monitoring the environment and focus on other essential tasks that better utilize their abilities. <br>
Sometimes lecture halls are booked as per the timetable, however, don’t use room for the class. So this system would check in real-time whether the room is occupied or not.If it is unoccupied at that point of time, it’s status will be declared as available so that lectures can be organized there. <br>
Apart from security and real-time room availability check, students can use this system to check the crowd in the canteen, mess, reading room, and library that are usually crowded and a lot of time gets wasted waiting in the long queue. So using this system, students can plan their visit to these places according to the crowd present thus saving their time.
